## ðŸ”¥ Architecture & Design Patterns

This project is built using well-established architectural principles and design patterns to ensure maintainability, scalability, and flexibility.

### âœ” MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)
The **MVVM** pattern separates UI logic from business logic, making the codebase cleaner and more maintainable. It allows for better testability and scalability.

### âœ” Dependency Injection (DI)
**Dependency Injection** promotes loose coupling by managing dependencies efficiently. It improves modularity, making the code easier to test and update.

### âœ” SOLID Principles
Applying **SOLID** principles ensures that the code remains **clean, reusable, and scalable**. Each principleâ€”Single Responsibility, Open-Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, and Dependency Inversionâ€”helps maintain high-quality software design.

### âœ” Service-Oriented Architecture
By adopting a **Service-Oriented Architecture**, the application remains **modular and adaptable**, making future updates or integrations seamless.
