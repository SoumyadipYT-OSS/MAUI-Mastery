## 🗄️ Data Handling & API Integration

This project employs robust data management techniques and efficient API integrations to ensure secure, reliable, and high-performance data handling.

### ✔ SQLite & Entity Framework
For **local database management**, this project leverages **SQLite and Entity Framework**, enabling **offline support** and seamless data persistence. This ensures that users can interact with stored data even when disconnected from the network.

### ✔ RESTful APIs & GraphQL
Integration of **RESTful APIs and GraphQL** allows efficient **data exchange** between the client and server. REST is great for traditional API interactions, while GraphQL enhances flexibility by enabling precise data retrieval, reducing over-fetching of information.

### ✔ Authentication & Security
Implementing **OAuth and JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** ensures **secure authentication and authorization**, safeguarding user data and API calls. Encryption techniques and security best practices are followed to protect sensitive information.

### ✔ MVVM Data Binding
Using **MVVM Data Binding**, the application achieves **reactive UI updates**, ensuring that changes in data sources immediately reflect in the user interface. This improves the application's responsiveness and enhances the overall user experience.

## 🚀 Benefits
- Secure and reliable data storage with offline support
- Efficient and optimized API communication
- Enhanced authentication and data protection
- Smooth UI experience with real-time updates
